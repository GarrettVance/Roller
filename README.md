# Roller
DirectX D3D11 first-person roller coaster on the Lorenz Attractor:

This is a complete solution for Visual Studio 2017 which builds a DirectX D3D11 application for Windows 10 UWP. You can build for either x64 debug or x64 release. 

Dependencies: The Roller project requires the Microsoft DirectXTK library of DirectX helper functions. DirectXTK is freely downloadable from github. Compile and link DirectXTK for x64 debug and/or x64 release targeting Windows 10, after which you can build the Roller project.  

While running the application, use the keyboard F5 and F6 keys to toggle the view between 3rd-person and first-person perspective. See the Screenshots directory for examples.
